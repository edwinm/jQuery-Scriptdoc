# jQuery Scriptdoc

In 2006 I started using the HTML/CSS/JavaScript editor [Aptana](http://www.aptana.com/) and the JavaScript library [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). Aptana was better than anything else, but unfortunately, jQuery support was not that great. Aptana did support Scriptdoc, a language in which you could describe a JavaScript library.

So to get proper jQuery support, I only had to write some scripts to convert the jQuery documentation to Scriptdocs Aptana could use. I also generated jQuery documentation that could be used inside Aptana.

I offered it for download. See [Code Assist for jQuery](http://www.bitstorm.org/edwin/jquery/) for the download page.

Not much later, it became the official, bundled jQuery support in Aptana.
